====================STEP 5==================
Implementing game over
Let's try to implement game over in our game. Here's the piece of code from the third lesson where we made the ball bounce off the walls:
============CODE=============

Instead of allowing the ball to bounce off all four walls, let's only allow three now — left, top and right. Hitting the bottom wall will end the game. We'll edit the second if block so it's an if else block that will trigger our "game over" state upon the ball colliding with the bottom edge of the canvas. For now we'll keep it simple, showing an alert message and restarting the game by reloading the page.

First, replace where you initially called setInterval()

setInterval(draw, 10);

WITH
const interval = setInterval(draw, 10);

Letting the paddle hit the ball
The last thing to do in this lesson is to create some kind of collision detection between the ball and the paddle, so it can bounce off it and get back into the play area. The easiest thing to do is to check whether the center of the ball is between the left and right edges of the paddle. Update the last bit of code you modified again, to the following:
==========CODE===============
If the ball hits the bottom edge of the Canvas we need to check whether it hits the paddle. If so, then it bounces off just like you'd expect; if not, then the game is over as before.

Next steps
We're doing quite well so far and our game is starting to feel a lot more worth playing now that you can lose! But it is still missing something. Let's move on to the sixth chapter — Build the brick field — and create some bricks for the ball to destroy.
